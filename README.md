# Women Tech Event Outreach Strategy

Women Tech Women Yes (WTWY) is a hypothetical non-profit group located in NY that is interested in promoting their group and upcoming summer gala. For outreach purposes, the group is able to provide 3 groups of 2 volunteers each to be posted at MTA station entrances and to encourage passersby to sign up for free tickets to the event.

In order to identify an optimal outreach strategy, publically available MTA data was used in conjunction with census data to target highly populated areas and specifically areas with more women, more women commuters, and more women employed as "professionals".

The repository directory structure is as follows:

* /data/ - includes all data used in analysis
* .py - scripts created to automate cleaning and plot generation
* .ipynb - all Jupyter Notebooks delineating cleaning and analysis steps
* .pdf - high level summary of steps and findings
